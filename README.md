# PulseEffects-Preset
PulseEffects-Preset for Sennheiser GameZero

Modified this Equalizer APO preset for PulseEffects. Equalizer APO is only for Windows. PulseEffects works on linux.

To use this preset with PulseEffects just place "GameZero.json" to your PulseEffects config folder. For me it's 
~/.config/pulseeffects/output/
